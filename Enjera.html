            <h2>What is Enjera Made Of</h2>
            <p>Injera is made with teff, a tiny, round grain that flourishes in the highlands of Ethiopia. While teff is very nutritious, it contains practically no gluten. This makes teff ill-suited for making raised bread; however, injera still takes advantage of the special properties of yeast.</p>

            <h2>How to Eat Ethiopian Food</h2>
            <p>Ethiopian food is a unique blend of European and Eastern cultures. This uniqueness can make it seem more inaccessible than it is. Ethiopian food is served on communal plates and generally eaten on bread with your fingers instead of utensils. In addition to using bread, you need to be aware of some basic rules of etiquette to enjoy the strong, spicy flavors and rich stews Ethiopia has to offer.</p>

            <p>After fermenting for 1 to 3 days, the injera batter is poured onto a hot griddle much like a pancake or crepe is cooked. Most traditional Ethiopian food is eaten with the hands; this is done by tearing off a piece of injera and using it to pick up a morsel of food.</p>
